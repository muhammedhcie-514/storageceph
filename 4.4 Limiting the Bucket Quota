4.4 Limiting the Bucket Quota
Bucket quotas can be configured for users or specified buckets, which will be practiced in
this exercise separately.
Step 1 Limit quotas for users.
Enable the quota limit for the swift user.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# radosgw-admin quota enable --quota-scope=user --uid=swift
Set the maximum number of objects that can be uploaded by the swift user to 3.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# radosgw-admin quota set --quota-scope=user --uid=swift --max-objects=3
Then, check whether the configurations take effect.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# radosgw-admin user info --uid=swift

Run the upload command on the client to test the quota limit. When the third file is
uploaded, the client receives an error message.

To cancel the limit on the object quantity quota, set --max-objects to -1.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# radosgw-admin quota set --quota-scope=user --uid=swift --max-objects=-1
Then, upload the third object again on the client. The upload is successful. The details are
as follows:
[root@client ~]# swift -A http://192.168.0.21:8080/auth/1.0 -U "swift:swift_rgw" -K
mtCMEbogngZZ1578VTPjcr8bXjsb61mso4ODx5E7 upload --object-name hosts3 test /etc/hosts --
insecure
hosts3
⚫ Question: In addition to setting the number of objects, are there any other methods
for limiting quotas?
⚫ Answer: Yes, the maximum upload capacity can be limited as well. This method is
demonstrated in limiting quotas for buckets.


Step 2 Limit quotas for buckets.
Enable the quota limit for the test bucket.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# radosgw-admin quota enable --quota-scope=bucket --bucket=test
Set the maximum capacity of the test bucket to 10 MB.

[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# radosgw-admin quota set --quota-scope=bucket --bucket=test --maxsize=10M



Check the changes have been applied.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# radosgw-admin bucket stats



Create a 6 MB file on the client to test the quota limit.
[root@client ~]# dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1M count=6


Upload the file to the test container (bucket). When the second file is uploaded, the
system returns an error message.
